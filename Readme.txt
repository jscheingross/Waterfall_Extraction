The attached matlab codes are designed to extract waterfalls from Lidar DEMs.  The ExampleCode_ExtractingWFs.m is an example that allows the user 
to specify key input variable. This code will run profile_generator.m (which extracts river long profiles) and wf_finder.m (which extracts waterfalls 
from river long  profiles).  These codes require TopoToolbox, which can be downloaded at https://topotoolbox.wordpress.com/. 

These codes were designed for the analysis presented in Groh and Scheingross, 2021, Geology.  Alternate uses may require modification.

Codes were written by Erika Groh and Joel Scheingross.  Questions can be directed to Joel Scheingross (jscheingross@unr.edu).
