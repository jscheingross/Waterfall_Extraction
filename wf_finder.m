%function that finds waterfalls and their metrics

%Meet the first condition (slope over threshold value):
thresh_slope_i = P.s_deg > thresh_slope; %this creates an index with values 0 = false and 1 = true if slope is over threshold for each location along the profile

diff_slope_i = diff(thresh_slope_i); %this finds the difference of each value in the index minus the value before it which means there will be a 1 where the index 
%goes from 0 to 1 and a -1 where the index goes from 1 to 0 so
%groups of 1 values in the slope index will be bounded by a 1 and -1 (1 at
%the top of the wf and -1 at the bottom of the wf)

dist_top = P.d(i_top); %this assigns the locations of the 1 and -1 values to the distance from outlet on the profile

%define waterfall height
dh = abs((z_bottom) - (z_top)); %this takes the elevation point at the top of the waterfall minus the bottom to get the change in height between them (i.e. height of waterfall)

%Meet the second condition (dropheight over threshold):
i_dhover = dh > thresh_dh;
wf_dh = dh(i_dhover); %this is saying there is a waterfall by given definition where the drop height is greater than the threshold value input
